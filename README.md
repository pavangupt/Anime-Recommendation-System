# Anime-Recommendation-System
Now-a-days, almost all the ecommerce or OTT platforms uses recommendation system to recommend to the user.In this project, I am going to built a recommendaton system for recommending anime's to the users with the help of Collaborative Filtering System. Before building such system ,we have to understand "What is Collaborative Based Filtering System"?

## What is Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System?
- In Collaborative Filtering, we tend to find similar users and recommend what similar users like. In this type of recommendation system, we donâ€™t use the features of the item to recommend it, rather we classify the users into the clusters of similar types, and recommend each user according to the preference of its cluster.
- In order to built a recommendation system, we will be using KNN ie. Nearest Neighbors- Cosine Similarity.
